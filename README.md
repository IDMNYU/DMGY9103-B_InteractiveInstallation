What is interactivity? What does it mean to create meaningful interactive experiences? In this hand-on course, students will learn how to create interactive installations and environments. Scale and space will be explored with reference to the body, throughout. Software (Max/MSP/Jitter), electronics and physical computing (Arduino) will be covered in a workshop style format, with the goal of students creating physical projects. A variety of mechanisms (edge detection, tracking, capacitance sensors, presence sensors, custom switches, etc) will be covered in workshops. Class discussions will cover readings about interactive art and design, space, installation. Students are free to explore their own ideas/concepts

### Program Goals

This course reinforces the IDM Program goals by

• Integrate multiple mediums of image, text, sound, physical, space, and interactivity. (Reinforced)

• Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. Skills acquisition. 

• Combine research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration. (Reinforced)

• Collaborate across disciplines.

• Adopt and use professional practices. (Reinforced)

• Integrate Cultural Literacy

• Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. Skills acquisition.

### Objectives

Students will gain a vocabulary for interactivity and learn a variety of tools and techniques to create interactive installations, including tracking, edge detection, sensors, basic electronics and physical computing. Students will gain knowledge of different methods to create interactive installations including: installations for 1 person, many people, time dependent or input dependent. Students will understand the difference between reactive, interactive and dynamically changing systems. 

Students are expected to bring ideas to explore with these techniques. The goals of the projects are not simply about the successful function of the technical process. The goal is to integrate these technical elements to make work that is about something. This could be a problem, phenomena, story, natural element, or other form of expression. This class is about exploring those on a physical scale, such as the body. Projects will create full scale and dynamic installation using both digital and physical means. These projects will be portfolio-level quality works.

####Quantitative Overview

• Exercises: 30% (5% each)
• Show & Tell presentations: 5%
• In-class discussions (readings & roundtable feedback), critiques: 5%
• Self-assessments and roundtable presentations: 5%
• Project 1: Change a Space: 10%
• Project 2: Midterm: Interactive Installation 20% (5% Prototype, 15% Midterm)
• Project 3: Final Project: 25% (10% Prototype, 15% Final)


A.	100 – 90%	Excellent, Outstanding, Superior
Performance, participation, attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, and pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands interactivity, has a developed and practically can create well-designed interactive installations.


B.	89 – 80%	Very Good / Good
Performance, participation, and attendance of student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average understanding of interactivity, yet not superior.


C.	79 – 70%	Satisfactory, OK, not bad
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of interactivity. Makes an avid attempt during the workshop and completes most of the workshops. Asks some questions in class, but a greater effort can be made to understand and apply the material. More time is needed to study, make, take risks and explore. Not pressing hard enough


D.	69 – 63%	Poor; Below Average
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many areas that show any understanding of interactivity. Minimal effort is being made on the students’ part. Problems include lack of interest, procrastination, and/or poor time management.


F.	Below 62%	Unacceptable
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest. Work submissions are missing, either in parts or completely missing.

###Attendance
•	Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class
•	Critique days are mandatory. No exceptions. No tardiness.
•	Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. (email is preferred)
•	Unexcused absences will affect your grade
•	One absence is allowed; after that, your final overall grade for the course will drop by 2.5 pts out of 100 for each additional absence.

###Participation

It’s imperative for you to be active in class – in discussion, research, and activity inside and outside of class. We are a community and your part is key, regardless of whether you may be struggling or not.

### Communication
<ul>
	<li>CHECK YOUR NYU EMAIL. Everyone must use their NYU email address for this class and all correspondence, as outlined by the Dean of the college.  I will be emailing you throughout the semester with announcements about class, projects, grades, web links, etc.  You are required to check your email several times a week, especially before class meets.</li>
	<li> Email me from your NYU email account ONLY (mandated by the Dean)</li>
	<li>If you find yourself emailing me a problem or an issue that exceeds 5 sentences, you need to meet with me, in person, to discuss that topic.  Please contact me about setting up a time. I’d happily meet you in person, during office hours, before class or after class. Do not assume that it’s okay to tell me about some major issue at a deadline. Ex. 8:40am on Critique day. It’s not okay. Would you do that to your boss or client? No. It’s no acceptable here either. </li>
	<li>o	I do greatly appreciate an email if you are going to be late, need to leave early or absent from class.</li>
	</ul>

###Show & Tell

In the first week, you will either volunteer or be assigned to 2 people from the list below. On the assigned date, bring in 2-3 examples each person/group’s of their work. Each date has at least 2 people/groups. Be familiar with a brief bio and be prepared to critically discuss/analyze the assigned individual and their supporting work in a dynamic presentation in front of the class. Do not be lame. Be informed.

In addition to Googling the people/projects, I encourage you to check out Eyeo’s website and Vimeo page, as well as Creative Applications site. Create a Keynote, Powerpoint or Google Drive presentation. Prepare the presentation to be 10-15 minutes TOTAL. After your presentation, upload your presentation after exporting it as a PDF. Upload the presentation PDF, titled with the Artist/Designer names, to the .....(TBD)

####Deliverables

###Sketchbook & Evernote/Mural.ly
You must have some sort of evidence and collection of your ideas, research, steps and action. This is imperative. You must be organized and be able to show the development of your ideas and concepts. Also, you’ll need to be taking notes in some form during workshops and demos. Figure out some way to aggregate this information for your own sanity. Evernote is perfect for this. It collects and intakes… well, everything!

###Self-Assessments – MidTerm and Final

After the MidTerm Critique and on the last day of class, submit a self-assessment addressing the following. Please be professional, honest and self-reflective.
<ol>
<li>Critically analyze/evaluate how much time was spent on learning technique/technical versus how much time was spent developing your idea/concept and strengthening it. </li>
<li>Critically analyze/evaluate how much time was spent on the exercises and the projects.</li>
<li>Comment on your successes. </li>
<li>Comment on your failures. </li>
<li>What are your plans to combat your failures?</li>
<li>What are your open issues?</li>
<li>How has your knowledge towards the subject changed?</li>
</ol>

###Deliverables for the Roundtable Discussions for MidTerm and Final Projects

Roundtable discussions will take place the week after the MidTerm Project and the Final Project briefs are released. These are in class discussions regarding your ideas for these projects. It’s an opportunity to bounce ideas off the group in order to get good feedback. This ensures a strong project that meets the minimum project requirements while investigating your conceptual interests.

In order to prepare for this presentation and to communicate your ideas to the class succinctly, the following is required for each of these roundtable presentations (MidTerm & Final).

You must have 3 separate/different ideas for EACH roundtable. For each idea present the following:

<ul>
<li>Describe the concept in 3 brief sentences</li> 
<li>Show links to 3 other similar works or influences – both technical and conceptual</li>
<li>Use the storyboard template provided (see “Resources” folder) to describe what the experience is like over time. What does it look like initially? What is the space like? How would I interact with it? How would it react to me? What would that reaction look like? Show the timeline of interactivity: when no one is around, when one person is around, when a group of people are around, when it turns on, when it turns off, how it turns on and off, etc, etc.</li>
<li>What space would this use on campus?</li>
<li>For the Final Project only: What is the interface?</li>
</ul>

###Deliverables for the MidTerm and the Final Projects 
<ul>
<li>Concept in 3-6 sentences</li>
<li>Links to influences and similar works – both conceptual and technical</li>
<li>Final patch(es)</li>
<li>All media required for the final</li>
<li>Documentation of the final projects: Video and Images showcasing interaction timeline.</li>
<li>A folder titled “Development” with the following inside of it:</li>
<ul>
<li>Initial working patches and previous versions</li>
<li>Documentation of things working: Video and Images showcasing development: circuits, working circuits, initial set-ups in space, physical items in those spaces </li>
<li>Sketches, including initial comic book and subsequent sketches</li>
</ul>
</ul>

###Project Descriptions
####Change a Space

Using brown roll paper as your main tool/item, transform a space. Think about how people move through the space. Create a mood or emotional by changing the architecture of the space. You may use hot glue, tacks, stapler guns, natural light, string, fishing line, tearing, scissors, etc for assemblage

####Midterm – theme TBA
Reflecting on the readings of Margaret Morse “The Poetics of Interactivity” and the David Rokeby reading “Transforming Mirrors” create an environment that responds to the viewer based on some form of input. This input should be physical or sonic. (We will cover computer vision techniques for the final). Remember the tails of Myron Krueger with his installation inputs and outputs in “Responsive Environments.” The interaction must be meaningful with the content and the output should be engaging to a group of people.

####Final – theme TBA

Create an interactive installation that uses either digital or physical inputs that creates an engaging experience with the viewer. Think of how the output and the input cover an area or space. What is this piece about? What topics are you exploring? What is your media?

###Technology in the Classroom

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for artists, designers, and students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting, especially in the classroom. When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, making class presentations, etc. As a general rule, the following uses are unacceptable: checking e-mail, instant messaging, texting, using Facebook, Google+, Flickr, Instagram, or other social networking sites. The quality of the class depends in large part on the quality of your attention and active participation. In particular, give your fellow students the respect you deserve in return, and close your laptop and give them your full attention when they are presenting work. Otherwise, you will be requested to close your laptop/phone in order to give the class your full attention.
