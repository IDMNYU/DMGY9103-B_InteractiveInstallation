## Final Project
## Interactive Installation

Create an interactive installation that uses either digital or physical inputs that creates an engaging experience with the viewer. Think of how the output and the input cover an area or space. What is this piece about? What topics are you exploring? What is your media?

This piece must be interactive AND it must change over time in some way. Consider how the experience of your piece changes over a period of time or develops. Think about what varys and appears at time. Think beyond random and more towards choreography. Consider surprise. Think of how we have viewed this, in a variety of the Show & Tell Artists.

Create a Dropbox folder and Share it with me. Entitle it: 

YourNameInteractiveInstallation_2018

And structure it like below. Note: That there should be new material in each week. IE, material is NOT copied over between Prototype Folder weeks without significant changes.

- Prototype_4_28_2016 10%
	- Conceptual
		- InfluencesResearch
		- Sketches

- Prototype_5_4_2016 10%
	- Development (10%)

		- circuits (images, schematics)
		- video documentation of things working together
		- documentation of working in space (images, video)
	- Conceptual

- Prototype_5_12_2016  25%
	- Development
		- patches leading up to the final one
		- any additional conceptual sketches, links, technical references, artists, designers, blogs, forums
	- Final Deliverables 
		- finalized patches + materials 
		- documentation of circuits + other supportive materials (behind the scenes)
		- documentation of your final installation, working and demonstrating interactivity + change over time. Portfolio quality (ie, edited and smooth)

<li>Links to influences and similar works â€“ both conceptual and technical(dropbox folder)</li>
<li>Initial working patches (dropbox folder)</li>
<li>Acquisition of physical materials, circuits, etc </li>
<li>Sketches, including initial comic book and subsequent sketches</li>


###Deliverables for Prototype II Due 5/4/2016  10%
<li> Developed patches and circuits. FAR BEYOND BASIC LEVEL (additional folder in dropbox)</li>
<li> Materials intergrated with digital elements AND working successfully on a basic level</li>
<li> Sketches that explore the concept of interactivity, change over time, etc </li>
<li> Evidence of working within your chosen space </li>
<li> Documentation of your process: images, video, developed sketches </li>
