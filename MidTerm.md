##MidTerm Project
##Interactive Installation

Reflecting on the readings of Margaret Morse “The Poetics of Interactivity” and the David Rokeby reading “Transforming Mirrors” create an environment that responds to the viewer based on some form of input. This input should be physical or sonic. (We will cover computer vision techniques for the final). Remember the tails of Myron Krueger with his installation inputs and outputs in “Responsive Environments.” The interaction must be meaningful with the content and the output should be engaging to a group of people.
